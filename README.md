**Objective & Scope**

● Objective: Determine when to send send staff members to different hospitals and clinics and understand how many staff members will be needed.

● Scope: The staffing agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states. 

**Key Questions**

● Why is it important to have a staffing plan?: An accurate staffing plan informs the agency of the correct timing and spacial distribution of medical personnel throughout the USA. 

● Why is it important to understand whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughought the entire year?: The staffing agency knows when to send the staff in each state based on the peak demand season.

● How does the categorisation of states help?: Prioritizing states with large vulnerable populations count based on the rating; high, medium and low need, greatly assists with planning.

**Flu Patients**

● Adults over 65 years of age are at higher risk of dying from flu related complications.

● More than 90% of Flu deaths occured among adults over the age of 65.

**When does flu season occur**

● Flu season occurs annually between October to April..

● Most of the Flu deaths occur between December and March.

● The top 5 states with the most flu deaths are California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.

**Flu Deaths Per State**

● States with the largest populations consistently report the highest flu deaths.

● On average California reports 6000 deaths related to flu annually.

● There is a strong correlation (0.96) between State and reported flu deaths..

**Summary**

● When planning for the next flu season, extra medical staff need to be deployed to states that have >500 deaths per year. This will help prioritize states with the highest flu mortality which is ? 2000 deaths.

● Based on the analysis, one needs to mobilise medical staff as the flu season reaches its peak at the onset of 2019, persisting until approximately April. Redeploying medical staff in October is also paramount.

**Next Steps**

● Staff to patient ratios and monthly flu hospitalisation data need to be accurately documented and collected to better prioritize states based on their need for additional medical staff.

● Key performance indicators to assess project success such as % of understaffed medical facilities and mortality rates need to be regularly monitored.
